      <h1>The Journey of Abdullah Al Fahim</h1>

        <p>I am Abdullah Al Fahim, born in Mirpur, Dhaka, Bangladesh in 1998. From the earliest days of my childhood, I was known for being straightforward, curious, and remarkably active. I loved asking questions, moving about, and involving myself in everything that caught my interest. What made my childhood truly unique was my constantly shifting educational journey‚ÄîI studied in eight different schools across the country before stepping into my youth. Each new institution, each classroom, and each group of friends gave me lessons beyond textbooks, shaping the foundation of who I am today. My formal education began in 2004 at St. John‚Äôs Government Primary School in Khulna, where I completed Baby Class and Class One. For me, this was the world opening up‚Äîchalk on blackboards, morning assemblies under the sun, and the energy of being among other children eager to learn. By 2006, my family had moved, and I found myself at 22 No. Chapta Government Primary School in Kashiani, Gopalganj, where I studied Class Two and Three. The rural atmosphere, with open fields surrounding the school, gave me a new perspective. Friendships came quickly, but I also learned how to adapt, to let go of one place and embrace another. Then came another shift‚Äî2007, when I moved to Winner Ideal School in Jamgora, Savar, Dhaka, and repeated Class Three. It was a reset of sorts, but it allowed me to strengthen my basics and grow more confident academically. In 2008, I entered BEPZA Public School and College, completing Class Four. The school‚Äôs structured environment introduced me to stricter discipline and a more formal education system. By 2009, I was in Gomail Government Primary School in Savar, Dhaka, where I studied Class Five. This was a memorable stage‚ÄîI was more mature, more focused, and ready for the next level of education. In 2010, I began Class Six at Amin Model Town School and College, Navinagar, Savar, Dhaka, but only for half the year until June. Life moved again, and I transferred to Sristy Central School in Khulna, where I continued from July 2010 to May 2011, finishing Class Six and Class Seven. It was a phase of self-discovery, as I balanced moving between schools while keeping my studies steady. The real turning point came in 2012, when I joined Naebunnessa Institution and studied from Class Eight to Class Ten. Here, I flourished academically. In Class Eight, I earned a General Scholarship from the Dhaka Board for my outstanding performance in the Junior School Certificate (JSC) examination. That achievement still stands as one of the proudest moments of my student life‚Äîa validation of the resilience built through constant transitions. In 2015, I stepped into my college years at Haji Lalmia City College, Gopalganj, where I studied until 2017. These years were marked not just by academics, but by my growing interest in leadership, communication, and participation in broader student activities. By 2018, I entered my university life at the Institute of Science, Trade & Technology (ISTT), affiliated with the National University of Bangladesh. This was a defining chapter. I was no longer just a student; I became an active contributor to the vibrant campus culture. I joined several clubs that shaped my leadership and creativity: IEEE ISTT Student Branch ‚Äì serving as an executive committee member, connecting with an international network of engineers; ISTT Innovation Hub ‚Äì where technology turned from theory into practice, sparking creativity in applied projects; Suvonil Literature and Cultural Club ‚Äì feeding my love for culture, literature, and artistic expression. But my involvement was not limited to campus alone. I actively participated in national and international organizations: as a Red Crescent Volunteer, I contributed to humanitarian causes, and as a Campus Ambassador for Bangladesh Youth Leadership Center (BYLC) and Youth Opportunities, I represented pioneering student development platforms, connecting with young leaders across the nation. My university years were colorful, energetic, and filled with experiences that made me more than a graduate‚Äîthey made me a leader and a doer.</p>

        <p>By 2021, I joined Farhanasbrainstation, a nationally recognized youth development platform on LinkedIn that worked on UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). I started as a Content Writer, but through hard work and dedication, I rose to become the Executive Director of Business Development. I worked there until December 2023, leaving behind a strong footprint in the organization‚Äôs growth. In May 2023, I also joined the National University Skill Development Forum (NUSDF), an organization dedicated to enhancing the skills of National University students. I began as an Executive of Creative Media, and soon earned a promotion to Head of Branding and Communication, a role I held until February 2025. Meanwhile, I successfully completed my undergraduate degree from ISTT in October 2023, and by November, I proudly held my certificate in hand. It was the crowning moment of years of perseverance in both academics and extracurricular endeavors. After graduation, I explored opportunities in IT, working as a Graphic Designer and in various IT-related roles. But in 2024, I made a significant leap in my career by joining Channel i, Bangladesh‚Äôs first digital satellite television network, as a Broadcast Engineer (Transmission). This role gave me the chance to merge technology, media, and my love for innovation into a professional path that inspires me every day.</p>

        <p>Outside academics and career, I have always been deeply passionate about football. The game has been a constant source of joy and energy for me, teaching me teamwork, strategy, and resilience. Whether watching international tournaments or playing casually, football has been a loyal companion throughout my journey. Looking back from a boy born in Mirpur, Dhaka, in 1998, shifting through eight schools, excelling in board examinations, thriving in university clubs, to becoming a Broadcast Engineer at Channel i, my journey has been full of movement, learning, and growth. Every transition, whether in school, college, or professional life, has been a stepping stone‚Äîbuilding resilience, leadership, and a passion for growth. I carry forward all these experiences with gratitude and ambition, knowing that my story is still unfolding, with much more yet to be written.</p>
